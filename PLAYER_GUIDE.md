# 2-Dimensional BedWars: Player Guide

Welcome to **2-Dimensional BedWars**, a unique twist on the classic minigame where you must defend bases in two parallel dimensions simultaneously!

## 🌌 The Concept: Split Worlds
The game takes place in a world split into two distinct arenas. You are not just fighting on one front; you are fighting on two.

-   **Arena 1 (The Overworld)**: A desert-themed arena located in the first half of the world.
-   **Arena 2 (The Nether)**: A hellish landscape located in the second half of the world.

**Every team has a base and a bed in BOTH arenas.** To win, you must destroy the beds of your enemies in **both dimensions**.

## ⚔️ Gameplay Mechanics

### 1. Death Swap
Using a custom respawn mechanic, **death is a portal**.
-   If you die in the **Overworld**, you will respawn in the **Nether**.
-   If you die in the **Nether**, you will respawn in the **Overworld**.

This allows you to quickly switch fronts, but be careful: if your bed in the *target* dimension is destroyed, you cannot respawn there!

### 2. Portal Travel
Vanilla Nether Portals are your gateways. Walking into a portal will instantly teleport you between your team's Overworld base and Nether base. Use this to escape danger or coordinate attacks.

### 3. Resource Split
Resources are distributed between the dimensions to force cross-dimensional play. You cannot camp in one world forever if you want the best gear.

#### **Overworld (Arena 1)**
-   **Iron**: Basic currency for blocks and tools.
-   **Diamond**: Currency for Team Upgrades.
-   **Emerald**: High-tier currency for powerful items.

#### **The Nether (Arena 2)**
-   **Quartz**: Alternate currency found in the Nether (replaces Iron).
-   **Gold**: Currency for better equipment.
-   **Netherite**: Ultra-rare currency for the strongest gear.

## 🏆 How to Win
1.  Protect your **Red/Blue/Green/Yellow** beds in both dimensions.
2.  Gather resources from both the Overworld and Nether.
3.  Travel between worlds to outmaneuver your opponents.
4.  Destroy both beds of an enemy team to eliminate them!
